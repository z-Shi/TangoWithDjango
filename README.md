# **Tango w/ Django - Implementation**

# **Overview**
Hi, as you can probably tell, this is my personal implementation of the Tango w/ Django eBook. It stores my solutions as I work through each chapter of the book.

# **Deployments**
Due to the way the course was set up, I had to split up my code into two versions - one covering the mandatory content, with the other storing the completed version. Consequently, I deployed each version to Python Anywhere separately:

*[Mandatory Content](https://zshi.pythonanywhere.com/rango/)
*[Completed Book](https://zshi2.pythonanywhere.com/rango/)
